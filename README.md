# React Data Visualization Project
This project is a data visualization application built with React using Vite, TailwindCSS, Recharts, and shadcn. The application consumes a given `.json` file containing dummy results for an advertising campaign and builds a data visualization. It displays the data through charts and provides three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- The campaign with the most impressions
- The campaign with the most clicks
- The date with the highest amount of combined activity (clicks and impressions)

## Features
- Intuitive data visualization using charts
- Clear labels for campaign names and dates
- Display of three KPIs
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS
- Modern component library with shadcn
